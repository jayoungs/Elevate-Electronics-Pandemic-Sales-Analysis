## Executive Summary

* **Overall Revenue Trends:**
The revenue drastically increased from 3.8M in 2019 to 10M in 2020 by 163% and declined gradually in 2021 and sharply in 2022, ending up at 5M. The surge in 2020 started in March when the pandemic hit and people bought electrinic products to set up their home office or deal with lockdown, and March records the highest month-over_month growth rate in both revenue and order count. This upward trend continued until both revenue and order count reached a peak in December. On the contrary, order count's momentum continued in 2021 until it started declining in 2022, which means that people placed more orders for less expensive items compared to 2020.

As much as Marh 2020 surge, we need to notice drops in the last quarter of 2022 because it was underperforming compared to 2019.
