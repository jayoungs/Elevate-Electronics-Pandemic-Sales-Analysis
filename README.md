## Executive Summary

* **Overall Revenue Trends:**
The revenue drastically increased from 3.8M in 2019 to 10M in 2020 by 163% and declined gradually in 2021 and sharply in 2022, ending up at 5M. The surge in 2020 started in March when the pandemic hit and people bought electrinic products to set up their home office or deal with lockdown, and so March shows the highest month-over_month growth rate in both revenue and order count. This upward revenue trend continued until 2021. On the contrary, order count's momentum continued longer through 2021 until it started declining in 2022, which means that in 2021, people placed more orders for less expensive items compared to 2020.

As much as Marh 2020 surge, we need to pay attention to drops in the last quarter of 2022 when we had the highest negative growth rates in revenue and order count. After the initial emergency phase had passed, in 2022 revenues trends went back to pre-pandemic 2019 level but even worse, in Q4, it started underperforming compared to that of 2019. Not being able to capitalizing on the pandemic sales boom and showing worst performance throughout the four years is alarming. Hence, it will be explored further in details in Deep Dive Insights below.
